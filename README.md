## SOP love letters to BASH, GIT, and GITHUB

for this project, I made three HTML5 semantic pages (love letters) for BASH, GIT and GITHUB expressing how to use each developer tool in the form of a love letter.

for the bash page, i made it look like an email window in a macbook. for the git page, i made it look like a letter written on a piece of lined paper. for the github page, i made it look like an e-postcard.
