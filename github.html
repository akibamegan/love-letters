			<h1>dear github...</h1>
			<p>its nice to finally get to know you. i've heard great things about you, but didn't really know how you functioned. now that i've been introduced to you, i understand how you work and i think that you're so cool.</p>
			<p>you let me work from anywhere. you also let me work with others and <i>collaborate</i> on the same project. after i tell you <i>git remote origin url</i> you let me store my local git <i>repositories</i> with a simple <i>push</i> and i can edit files from anywhere. if i work online then i just <i>pull</i> the files to my local machine. thanks for being so awesome. thanks for making it easy to let me share my work with the world.</p>
			<p>i hope we get to know each other better as time goes on. i appreciate you already more than you will ever know. stay amazing.</p>
			<p>with love, megan.</p>
