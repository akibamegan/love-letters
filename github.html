		<h2>dear github...</h2>
		<p>its nice to finally get to know you. i've heard great things about you, but didn't really know how you functioned. now that i've been introduced to you, i understand how you work and i think that you're so cool.</p>
		<p>you let me work from anywhere. you also let me work with others and <b>collaborate</b> on the same project. after i tell you <b>git remote origin url</b> you let me store my local git <b>repositories</b> with a simple <b>push</b> and i can edit files from anywhere. if i work online then i just <b>pull</b> the files to my local machine. thanks for being so awesome. thanks for making it easy to let me share my work with the world.</p>
		<p>i hope we get to know each other better as time goes on. i appreciate you already more than you will ever know. stay amazing.</p>
		<p>with love, megan.</p>
