		<p>where do i start... you are so forgiving when it comes to mistakes. all i needed was a <b>git init</b> in the directory i wanted to work with to create a hidden .git folder locally to start. and i just have to say... you're so easy to read. all i have to do is <b>git status</b> to know your current state. if i make any changes to my work, you will know right away and tell me if i ask again.</p>
		<p>when i told you that i was ready to move on, you were kind of particular when i wanted to move to the next step. i had to use <b>git add .</b> before you were ready to commit... but thats okay. you assured me that our status was in the clear and you were ready to commit, as well.</p>
		<p>i knew you were perfect when i was ready to save changes in history so you let me <b>git commit -m</b> and even let me add a description or message. thank goodness that you are so smart and remember everything from the past when i do that so that i don't have to keep my own records. if i wanted to see all the work you had done, all i had to do was <b>git log</b> and you displayed all of the information i needed. thank you.</p>
		<p>the real reason that i love you is because you make my big, bad mistakes look like they never happen. one day i made a big mistake and left my laptop open, and my cat came and walked across the keyboard. he ruined my files and i thought i lost all my work, but you assured me that it wasn't a problem. all i needed was a <b>git checkout</b> and you brought back all my work. a real lifesaver you are, git.</p>
		<p>don't ever change, and thanks for keeping up with all of my hard work.</p>
		<p>love, megan.</p>
