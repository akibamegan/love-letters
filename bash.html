		<p>have i told you lately that i love you?</p>
		<p>you're so easy to navigate... and you listen to all of my commands. </p>
		<p>i say <b>pwd</b> and you tell me exactly where i am working. i say <b>ls</b> and you don't hesitate to list out everything i want to see. i say <b>cd</b> when i want to go somewhere else and you take me to wherever i desire to be with no hesitation. you're also so smart... i say <b>open</b> filename and you show me exactly what i am looking for.</p>
		<p>bash, you make loving you easy with an effortless <b>touch</b>. i can't believe i got so lucky to run into you in the <b>terminal</b>. it was love at first sight, and now i know you are so much more than that. you are so easy to connect with. you even help me connect to the server to upload my files without using those silly little GUIs. </p>
